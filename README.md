# Prateek Pandey — Resume

This repository contains my resume and a simple webpage to view/download it.

## How to Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., `resume`).
2. Upload the two files from this folder:  
   - `index.html`  
   - `Prateek_Pandey_CV_Clean_Final.pdf`
3. Commit the changes.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages** in your GitHub repository.
5. Under "Source", select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder. Save.
6. Wait a few seconds — your resume will be live at:  
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>`
